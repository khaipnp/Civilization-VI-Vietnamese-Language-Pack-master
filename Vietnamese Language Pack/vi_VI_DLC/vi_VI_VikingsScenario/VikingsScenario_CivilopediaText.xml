Bị bỏ lại ở Lincolnshire để phụ trách hạm đội, anh ấy đã gặp Aelfgifu, người đã sinh cho ông hai đứa con trai. Sweyn được chấp nhận làm vua của nước Anh nhưng qua đời vào năm 1014 và người Anh đã đưa Aethelred trở lại làm vua của họ. Trong năm đó, Canute quay lại thách thức con trai của Aethelred để giành lấy ngai vàng. Đến cuối tháng 11 năm 1016, mọi chuyện kết thúc và Canute thống trị toàn bộ nước Anh. Sau đó, ông đã dành phần lớn thời gian còn lại của cuộc đời mình (mất năm 1035) để đối phó với các mối đe dọa đến từ các vị vua Đan Mạch khác, và thường sử dụng quân đội Anh để làm việc đó.</Text>

			<Text>Located in the middle of the foothills of the Pyrenees, in a rounded valley in Navarre, Pamplona alternated between self-rule, Visigoth domination, and Frankish suzerainty throughout the 9th Century. Expanding and contracting in cycles as well, the ruler of the Kingdom of Pamplona, Garcia Iniguez, allied his land with Christian Asturias to fend off the Moorish threat. It didn't do him much good against the Vikings, however, who captured the king in 859 (or so) and returned him only for a hefty ransom (according to legend, some 70 thousand gold dinars). The historian Ann Christys makes a strong case, however, that this whole episode is unsupported by records and probably apocryphal. As for Pamplona, the kingdom was eventually saved for Christianity when the freed king Garcia and his new friend Ordono I of Asturias together defeated Musa ibn Musa and a Cordoban army at the battle of Albelda.</Text>

Indeed, by the mid-700s the town was on its way to being a thriving port and a major trading center. Then came the Vikings Bjorn Ironside and Hastein, who had been raiding the Mediterranean Muslim towns and now set their sights on a few Christian ones. After pillaging the south of France and wintering there, they descended on unprotected Pisa, capturing and sacking it in 861 AD. Proceeding inland, the horde took the walled town of Luni, which according to legend the ignorant savages believed to be Rome, by ruse. With the surviving Norse warriors fretful, and since the leaders had always declared Rome the final target, they sailed back to the straits at Gibraltar … where they suffered heavy losses (some 40 ships and crews) in a naval battle with the Saracen navy from al-Andalus. Pisa was rebuilt, and never again troubled by Vikings.</Text>

Moreover, when the Bulgars converted to Christianity in 864, a number of churches and monasteries were built in and around the town walls. Being an important strategic and religious center, however, proved Preslav’s undoing. In the 960s and for several decades thereafter, the wars between the Byzantines and the Kievan Rus saw it ravaged and burnt several times. The cycle of conquerors looted the treasury, carried off the crown regalia, and even stole a large part of the famed library of Simeon. The outskirts and monasteries were largely abandoned.

As part of the Danes’ campaign to drive the king of Mercia (one Burgred) out, the Vikings sacked Tamworth in 874.
